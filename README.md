# Future Emission Predicting

This repository contains a project focused on predicting future emissions. The project utilizes Jupyter Notebook as the main language for implementation.

## Features

- Emission data analysis
- Machine learning models for emission prediction
- Visualization of emission trends
- Forecasting future emission levels

## Technologies Used

- Jupyter Notebook
- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## Prerequisites

- Jupyter Notebook installed on the system
- Python environment set up
- Required libraries like Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, and Seaborn installed

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/future-emission-predicting.git
   ```
2. Open the project in Jupyter Notebook.

## Configuration

No specific configuration needed for this project.

## Usage

To use the project, follow these steps:
1. Load the emission data using Pandas:
   ```python
   import pandas as pd
   data = pd.read_csv('emission_data.csv')
   ```

2. Explore the data and perform analysis:
   ```python
   # code snippets for data exploration
   ```

3. Train machine learning models for emission prediction:
   ```python
   # code snippets for model training
   ```

4. Visualize emission trends and forecast future values:
   ```python
   # code snippets for data visualization
   ```
